<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  The Demo can be seen in the following link: https://musing-ritchie-7ec618.netlify.app
- What was your experience?
  This was a easy example for begginers, I alredy have some of the necesary skill but i was triying to reinforce all the knowledge that i had.
- What have you learned/improved?
  In first place, i was trying to do this problem with some row and columns adjustin the width according to the resolution. But later i realize it would be a lot easier with flexbox,
  so i use flexbox to manipulate the position of the central contents and later I just add some css from sigma.
  In second place, for the mobile version i just have to change some css for better quality and adjust the flexbox-direction property to column and the flexbox did all the word.
  
- Your wisdom? :)
